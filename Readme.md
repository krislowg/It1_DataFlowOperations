## Database data flows

### CSVParser
- The first iteration is just reading from a csv file 
and then printing it out.

### JSON (GSON) 
- First iteration, read a csv file 
and then load it into a database

### XML (SOUP)
- Extra credit if also complete JSON task with JSoup (XML).

Iteration 2: Add JDBC & GSON to your Maven project, read the contents of a CSV, and insert this into the provided database.
             You will need to insert into "author" from the json file (the three fields in the json file)
             And "book" with some of the information from the csv file (see bottom)
